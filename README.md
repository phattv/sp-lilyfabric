# Lilyfabric
Project of 2 young couple, trying to learn as much as possible about web development & real-life custom-tailored fashion shop business experience.

## Project setup
- Install node js v6 (6.10.3), [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md) is recommended
- Install angular-cli tool: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Install npm packages: `npm install`

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Command line usage (angular-cli)
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0.
- Help `ng` or check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
- New component `ng g component components/new-component` (automatically add reference in the app.module.ts)
- New *app-level* service `ng g service shared/new-service`
- New *component-level* service/pipe/component, manually create new file in the component directory

## Build
- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- Run `ng build --prod` flag for a production build.
- Run `npm run sw` to generate `service-worker.js` for `dist/`
- Run `npm run serve-dist` to serve dist folder in localhost.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
